<p>I’ll be organizing the a list of Sometimes Asked Questions in this post - updating every few days.</p>
<div id="what-are-git-error-trapping-and-debugging" class="section level3">
<h3>What are git, error trapping, and debugging?</h3>
<p>These expressions all came up in <a href="https://robwschlegel.github.io/Intro_R_Workshop/prelim.html#why-use-r">Section 1.3</a> of the Intro to R page I asked you to read.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>git</strong>: Is a version tracking software. Most people who work with code (and especially in a team) find using version tracking software useful. It allows you to reclaim code lines you had previously deleted, split off a new version of your code for trialing before integrating it back in, and allows you to sync work between computers. It’s basic use works a lot like what you find on Google Docs where you can see the edit history and return to a previous state as needed.</li>
<li><strong>Error Trapping</strong>: This is the process by which you can build in elements of your code that will test to see whether the outcome has “worked” or produces something useful for you code to continue. For example, you might get into a situation where the result of some calculation doesn’t produce a number (it creates an “NA” or “Not Available” entry) that the rest of your code is relying on. Rather than let the code play out and make a mess, you can “trap” this error and either modify how your code continues or stop your code and send an error message to the console.</li>
<li><strong>Debugging</strong>: The process by which your code wont work the way you want it to and you will have to go back through the code to find the “bug” or incorrect use of a function and correct it.</li>
</ul>

<div id="what-is-the-difference-between-a-double-and-an-integer-why-would-we-use-integers" class="section level3">
<h3>What is the difference between a double and an integer? Why would we use integers?</h3>
<p>A double is a decimal number (i.e. 4.56) and an integer is a rounded whole (1, 2 ,3, etc.). R is pretty flexible about which is which compared to other languages. The main difference for other languages where speed and space might be an issue is that storing integers takes less space and are can be recalled quicker. This wont be a problem for the kind of work we’re doing, but it’s at least good to be aware of.</p>
</div>
<div id="are-there-any-usability-differencesdrawbacks-in-the-cloud-vs.-normal-rstudio" class="section level3">
<h3>Are there any usability differences/drawbacks in the cloud vs. normal RStudio?</h3>
<p>You have the same functionality on the cloud as you do with desktop RStudio. The only difference might be in performance - the cloud has to send you commands to a computer somewhere else, run the code, and then send the output back to you. It may run just a little slower as a result. The up-side for this class though is that I have access to all your work and can jump in to check how you’re doing, add comments/suggestions, and help debug your code as needed. You can also share your projects with your peers so they can see your work too.</p>
</div>
<div id="can-you-pick-some-columns-not-to-load-with-the-csv-or-do-you-have-to-remove-them-after-the-dataset-is-loaded" class="section level3">
<h3>Can you pick some columns not to load with the csv, or do you have to remove them after the dataset is loaded?</h3>
<p>You <em>can</em> choose specific columns to load in. See the help file for <code>read_csv()</code> by entering <code>?read_csv</code> into the console and pressing enter. These help files exist for all functions in R and explain how each function works and what arguments (choices) are available to you. In this case, the <code>col_types</code> argument will allow you to select only certain columns, but unless you data set is HUGE then in my experience it’s almost always easier just to read in all of it and then slim down after.</p>
</div>
<div id="is-r-a-combination-of-programs-such-as-python-and-excel-or-does-it-lean-more-towards-one-of-these-in-terms-of-function" class="section level3">
<h3>Is R a combination of programs such as python and excel or does it lean more towards one of these in terms of function?</h3>
<p>R is it’s own thing - a language unto itself. It has similarities to both python (another widely used, accessible programming language) and Excel, but operates independently of both. In terms of how it functions, the coding nature of R leans it towards python and away from the point-and-click, visual processes in Excel. So, how do R and Python compare? Python is more flexible than R - you can use more easily for all manner of tasks on a computer and set it to task organizing files, running monitoring devices, etc, but R is still the go-to for data analysis and visualization, which is built into python as an after-thought and doesn’t have the same level of completeness or community support. R was build specifically for working with data.</p>
</div>
<div id="what-is-the-difference-between-data-types-integer-and-character" class="section level3">
<h3>What is the difference between data types integer and character?</h3>
<p>Integers are whole numbers (e.g. 1, 5, 75, etc.) and characters are words (e.g. “hello”, “testing”, “this thing with spaces”, etc.)</p>
</div>
<div id="is-the-syntax-in-r-similar-to-any-other-language-which-is-it-closest-to" class="section level3">
<h3>Is the syntax in R similar to any other language, which is it closest to?</h3>
<p>Each language is unique in some sense. R probably skews closest to Python in how it looks (but also MATLAB and Java) - vectors are indexed using [ ], functions are run with ( ) containing the arguments. However, there are also some big differences that I am happy to discuss with anyone interested. Another similarity between R and Python are that they are both interactive languages - you can write scripts but also enter commands directly in the console. This differs from other languages (such as C++ and FORTRAN) where the only way to implement code is through scripting.</p>
</div>
<div id="does-the-data-for-the-data-frames-have-to-be-entered-in-r-or-can-it-be-imported-from-external-sources-or-programs" class="section level3">
<h3>Does the data for the data frames have to be entered in R or can it be imported from external sources or programs?</h3>
<p>You can indeed enter data manually into R, but the most efficient process is to read in the data from some external source. We have seen one example in <a href="../../classes/visualize/01-introduction/level-3/">Module 1, Level 3</a> of how to import data from a Comma Separated Value file (pretty common data format), but there are also functions in R to read pretty much any other data format you care to think of - NetCDF, JSON, TSV, Shapefiles, XML, YAML, HTML, JPEG, GeoTIFF, etc.</p>
