## Bathymetry

You might find it neccessary to use bathymetry data in your visualization so I'm including some here.

The data come from the General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans, produced by the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) and the United Nations' (UNESCO) Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC). I downloaded it at 0.25 deg resolution from the [NASA Earth Observations site](https://neo.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/view.php?datasetId=GEBCO_BATHY)

You can download a well-formatted version of the data [here](bathy.csv)

The fields are:

* lon: Longitude (°E)
* lat: Latitude (°N)
* z: height above surface (m) - note negative values are below the surface.
