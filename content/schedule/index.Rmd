Subject to some changes, but here's the basic layout

```{r, echo = F, message = F, warning=F}
library(tidyverse)

dates <- c(paste0("2021-10-",str_pad(c(12,14,15,18,19,21,22,25,26,28,29),"0")), paste0("2021-11-",str_pad(c(1,2,3),2,"left","0"))) 

times <- paste(dates, c("13:30","10:45","10:45","10:45","13:30","10:45","10:45","10:45","13:30","10:45","10:45","10:45","13:30","10:45"))

times <- lubridate::ymd_hm(times)

schedule <- tibble(Day = format(times,"%a %h %d %H:%M"))

schedule <- mutate(schedule, 
                   Activity = c("Introduction",
                                "Writing for Voice L1",
