<p>Effective design for communication isn’t just limited to the figures you produce for a paper or infographic, it’s the sum of all the elements on your presentation - the figure, the text, the images, the titling. In this level we’re going to think about these other elements and how they are combined for one specific communication tool - the <a href="https://ohiostate.pressbooks.pub/scientificposterguide/chapter/scientific-posters/">scientific poster</a>.</p>
<p>Some of you may have already made a scientific poster - they are usually big displays (48’‘x36’’) of the results of a scientific experiment, fieldwork, methodology, etc. that scientists show at a conference. We’re going to be making one for our oceanographic research proposal.</p>

<h2>Reading</h2>
<p>To be able to discuss poster design with some theory in mind, I’d like you to read the following resources which talk about graphic design principals:</p>

<p>Please take some notes as you read on points that might speak to effective poster design.</p>

<h2>Exercise</h2>
<p>We’re now going to apply some of these design ideas to scientific posters more specifically.</p>
<p>Below are some poster examples.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="posters/poster1.jpg">Poster 1</a></li>
<li><a href="posters/poster2.pdf">Poster 2</a></li>
<li><a href="posters/poster3.pdf">Poster 3</a></li>
<li><a href="posters/poster4.jpg">Poster 4</a></li>
<li><a href="posters/poster5.pdf">Poster 5</a></li>
<li><a href="posters/poster6.png">Poster 6</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I will assign you a group and a poster to discuss. You should review your poster together and think about the answers to the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the audience for this poster?</li>
<li>How easy was it to get the general message? Why?</li>
<li>What design elements were effective?</li>
<li>What design elements were ineffective?</li>
</ul>
<p>In class you will present your ideas on these points and we will talk as a group more generally about good design strategies.</p>
