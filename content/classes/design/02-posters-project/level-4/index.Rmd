Now that you've made and presented your poster, it's time to reflect on your work and that of your peers.

Take some time to look at your poster now it's complete and reflect on the answers to the following questions:

* What parts of the poster were you particularly happy with and why?
* What parts of your poster either didn't come out like you hoped or could use some improvement?

You should also pick another class poster to review.

* What works and what doesn't work for you on their poster?
* How does this relate to what we learnt about best practices in poster design?

Combine the ideas to the above reflections:

* How would you approach making a poster differently in the future?

Submit you answers to these reflection in a one-page (minimum) document to the assignment below.
