<p>Now that we’re seen a little of the mechanics of writing for voice, we’re going to talk a little about what choices we can make when communicating about the environment, and more specifically, about climate change.</p>
<div id="reading" class="section level2">
<h2>Reading</h2>
<p>Start by reading the Foreword (pg 1) and the sections on “Crafting your message” (pg 21-44) and “Overcoming Barriers” (just subsection 7, pg 45-55) in <a href="ecoAmerica-CRED-2014-Connecting-on-Climate.pdf">Connecting on Climate: A Guide for Effective Climate Change Communication</a> by
The Center for Research on Environmental Decisions (CRED) at The Earth Institute, Columbia University, and ecoAmerica, a climate solutions nonprofit.</p>
<p>As you read, take note of a handful of idea that speak to you as being either new ideas or things you want to remember.</p>
</div>
<div id="exercise" class="section level2">
<h2>Exercise</h2>
<p>Working in a team, discuss the reading and come up with a joint list of the three concepts/strategies that spoke to you as a group the most.</p>
<p>Come up with a team skit that tries to demonstrate these three strategies in both an ineffective and effective manner. As an example, you could create a scene in which the communication about a particular topic is handled badly for all three elements and then repeat the scene with more effective strategies employed.</p>
