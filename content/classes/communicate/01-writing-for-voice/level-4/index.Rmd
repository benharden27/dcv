To practice what you have learned so far, I'd like you to write a very short piece that seeks to explain a concept you've been learning about in oceanography class to a general public audience. 

## Exercise

* Pick a concept/topic in oceanography that you think is interesting and would want to tell others about.
* Think of a specific family member/friend who you think might be interested in it, but who wont already be familiar.
* Write a 200-300 word script intended to be spoken that describes the process to your chosen audience whilst upholding good practices in radio writing and strategies for communicating science/climate.
* Submit on the Google Classroom link below.
