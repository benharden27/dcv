<p>To practice what you have learned so far, I’d like you to write a very short piece that seeks to explain a concept you’ve been learning about in oceanography class to a general public audience.</p>
<div id="exercise" class="section level2">
<h2>Exercise</h2>
<ul>
<li>Pick a concept/topic in oceanography that you think is interesting and would want to tell others about.</li>
<li>Think of a specific family member/friend who you think might be interested in it, but who wont already be familiar.</li>
<li>Write a 200-300 word script intended to be spoken that describes the process to your chosen audience whilst upholding good practices in radio writing and strategies for communicating science/climate.</li>
<li>Submit on the Google Classroom link below.</li>
</ul>
</div>
