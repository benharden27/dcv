<h2>Excercise</h2>
<p>You should watch/listen to you assigned story a few times and take notes on the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is key climate topic is being addressed?</li>
<li>What type of story is this story? Is the story wrapped up by the end of the piece?</li>
<li>Who are the characters who are taking action? What are they doing?</li>
<li>What elements of effective communication that we explored in the previous module are on display here? What is less effective about the mode of delivery?</li>
<li>How could you tell this story differently?</li>
</ul>
<p>In class, you will meet with your peers assigned the same story and gather your ideas together to present to the group.</p>
<p>Fill in an exit ticket when you are done.</p>
