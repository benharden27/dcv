<p>Your communication project will be a single person narrated radio story about some element of oceans and their relationship to climate change. It will end up being about 2 minutes long and should seek to incorporate many elements of our discussions around writing for voice, communicating about the climate and storytelling.</p>
<p>Your first step is to decide on what story you are going to tell. We’ll have some in-class discussions to help this process, but you should also spend a little time searching on the internet or in the SEA library for inspiration. Your story can be about anything so long as it relates to oceans and climate.</p>
<p>Once you have some proto-ideas, you should fill out this worksheet to expand your ideas and think about how specifically you want to tell the story. You should list a few ideas as a starting point and list some pros and cons. Once you’ve settled on an idea, you will need to explain:</p>
<ul>
<li>What you story will be about?</li>
<li>Who is the main character and what do they want?</li>
<li>What happens at the beginning, middle and end?</li>
<li>What kind of story will this be?</li>
<li>How you hope this story will leave people feeling?</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you’ve completed this form, you can hand it to me and I’ll give some feedback before we both agree on a course of action.</p>
<p>Then fill out an exit ticket and move on to drafting your story!</p>
