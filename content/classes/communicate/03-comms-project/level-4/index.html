<p>Youâ€™ve done a complicated thing in producing your climate story by combining good writing for voice, effective environmental communication, and storytelling elements.</p>
<p>You should now reflect on this process by submitting at least one page (12pt, double-spaced), but no more than two pages that seeks to answer the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>What did you think of your final story? What were some of the strong aspects and what do you think could have been improved?</p></li>
<li><p>What were some of the enjoyable and challenging aspects of writing and preforming a radio story?</p></li>
<li><p>How would you change/improve this story given more time and access to possible interview subjects? What other voices would have been good to hear from?</p></li>
<li><p>What did you learn about yourself as a communicator through undertaking this project and how would this change your approach to doing another communication project?</p></li>
</ul>
