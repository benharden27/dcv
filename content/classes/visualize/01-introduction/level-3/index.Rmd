If you've used Excel before, you'll be pretty familiar with the spreadsheet layout of data where we have rows and columns. The data sets you'll be working with in R are also organized in the same way (although this is not the only way R organizes data). R calls them data frames.

## Data in R

Watch this brief intro to importing data into a data frame in R, and how it differs from using data in Excel.

## Exploring Data in R

The video above introduced you to how we get data into R using the `read_csv()` function from the `readr` package 

```{r, message=F}
library(readr)
df <- read_csv("C282_neuston.csv")
```

The data has been imported in to an object `df` which is a data frame (technically a `tibble` which is readr's slightly modified version of a data frame, but let's not get bogged down in details just yet). This data frame showed up in the Environment panel and if you click on the small spreadsheet icon you can see the data in a visual format. 

There are other ways to view and get to know our data.

Instead of clicking on that icon, you can also type in the console:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
View(df)
```

*capital "V" is important*

We can also simply type the name of the data frame:

```{r}
df
```

Which shows us a brief view of the data:

* The first line tells us that this is a tibble (data frame) with dimensions of `r nrow(df)` rows and `r ncol(df)` columns.
* The second line tells us the names of each columns (as many as will fit on the screen).
* The third line tells you what type of data is in each column: character, datetime, double (decimal number), integer (whole number).
* Then comes the first 10 line of data under each column heading.
* At the end of the data is one or more lines that tells you that there are `r nrow(df)-10` more rows of data and how many more variables (column names) are not shown (and their names and types).

We can also find the number of rows in a data frame:

```{r, include = TRUE}
nrow(df)
```

and same for columns:

```{r, include = TRUE}
ncol(df)
```

Or both dimenstions together:

```{r}
dim(df)
```

which gives us a vector of length 2, the first value being the number of rows and the second the number of columns.

Another great way to get a quick look at data in a data frame is to create a summary.

```{r, include = TRUE}
summary(df)
```

This gives us a bunch of statistical data on each of the columns that aren't full of characters -- min, max, quartiles, etc.



<!-- You can also get all the names of columns: -->

<!-- ```{r, include = TRUE} -->
<!-- names(df) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- If you want to access just one column of the data as a vector, the easiest way is usually with `$`: -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- df$temp -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- But we can also access the same column of data using `[[...]]` with either the name or the column number (also known as the column index). The following will work the sae as above -->

<!-- ```{r, eval = FALSE} -->
<!-- df[["temp"]] -->
<!-- df[[5]] -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- Or we can access a single column data frame using `[...]`: -->

<!-- ```{r, eval = FALSE} -->
<!-- df["temp"] -->
<!-- df[5] -->
<!-- ``` -->

## Exercise

The data in this exercise if hourly records of surface ocean data collected on a cruise from Woods Hole, MA, to Grenada, Caribbean. The cruise track is shown below.

```{r, echo = F, message = F, warming = F}
library(tidyverse)
read_csv("hourly_data.csv") %>%
ggplot(aes(lon, lat)) +
  geom_polygon(aes(long, lat, group = group), fill = "grey75", data = map_data("world")) +
  geom_path() +
  coord_quickmap(ylim = c(10,50), xlim = c(-100,-50)) +
  theme_void()
```

Go to the RStudio Cloud assignment below. Read the `instructions.txt` file and complete the exercise.
