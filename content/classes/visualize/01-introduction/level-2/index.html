<p>Now that we know a little about R and why we might want to use it, it’s time to learn some of the basics.</p>
<div id="r-familiarization" class="section level2">
<h2>R Familiarization</h2>
<p>If you’ve never used R or RStudio before it’s worth a little bit of orientation. Follow the following steps to begin your familiarization:</p>
<div id="basic-r" class="section level3">
<h3>1. Basic R</h3>
<p>You can get some information on how to use R from <a href="https://rstudio.cloud/learn/primers/1.2">this tutorial</a>. Watch the videos and run the interactive code chunks to learn some of the basics.</p>
</div>
<div id="rstudio-interface" class="section level3">
<h3>2. RStudio Interface</h3>
<p>Watch this video to orient yourself to the RStudio Interface. RStudio is a user friendly application that makes running R code a little easier. It is the interface you will be using on the RStudio Cloud.</p>

<div id="scripting" class="section level3">
<h3>3. Scripting</h3>
<p>The final part of the video above talks about scripting. I like to think of scripts as a little like recipes. You lay out the ingredients and logical steps someone (or future you!) would need to follow in order to get a particular, reproducible outcome. In this case, it’s R that is going to follow your script to do a particular analysis or make a plot. Although a cake would be nice.</p>
<p>Writing commands in the console is a little like cooking on the fly with whatever you have to hand. Sometimes that’s the right way to make a meal (or play with data). Most times though, you’re going to want to make a script to record what you’ve done.</p>
<p>Below is a quick video intro to making a script.</p>

<div id="exercise" class="section level2">
<h2>Exercise</h2>
<p>Follow the link below which will take you to a project in RStudio Cloud. In that project, you should open (double-click) <code>instructions.txt</code> in the files window (bottom right) and follow the instructions.</p>
<!-- 1. Open a new script file and name it "test_script.R" -->
<!-- 1. Use this script to record the steps you would take to do the following: -->
<!--   1. Make a new object which is a vector of the numbers 1, 3, 5, 8, 11, 20 -->
<!--   1. Extract the 3rd value in this vector -->
<!--   1. Find the mean and range of this vector -->
<!--   1. Make a new object with is your original object multiplied by 10 -->
<!-- 1. Comment your lines of code so you know what each line does -->
<p>Once you’ve finished, click the “Exit Ticket” button to inform me that you’ve completed the level and need feedback.</p>
