<p>For this level, I’m going to ask you to reflect on your project work and the visualize module more generally.</p>
<p>In no more than 2 pages (12pt, double-spaced), you should reflect on:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>What you thought of your final visualization - What were you happy with? What were you disappointed with?</p></li>
<li><p>What changes you would make to what you have given more time/understanding.</p></li>
<li><p>What further development you could imagine for this kind of data display (doesn’t matter if you don’t know if this would be possible).</p></li>
<li><p>The process of creating the visualization: What key takeaways will you have from going through this project work (R, data design, personal workflow, etc.)</p></li>
<li><p>The use of a coded language in generating visualizations.</p></li>
</ul>
