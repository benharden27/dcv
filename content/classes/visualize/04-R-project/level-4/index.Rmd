For this level, I'm going to ask you to reflect on your project work and the visualize module more generally.

In no more than 2 pages (12pt, double-spaced), you should reflect on:

* What you thought of your final visualization - What were you happy with? What were you disappointed with?

* What changes you would make to what you have given more time/understanding.

* What further development you could imagine for this kind of data display (doesn't matter if you don't know if this would be possible).

* The process of creating the visualization: What key takeaways will you have from going through this project work (R, data design, personal workflow, etc.)

* The use of a coded language in generating visualizations.
