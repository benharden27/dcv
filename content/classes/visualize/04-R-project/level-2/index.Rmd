Once you've completed your visualization planning document and handed it to me, I will get back to you with feedback and we will agree on a plan.

Once that plan has been established, you should begin gathering and experimenting with the data sets we've discussed in order to make a draft visualization. This draft will undergo peer review and you will also receive feedback from me. 

The peer review session is scheduled for the class period on Thurs Oct 28 - you should come with three copies of your visualization printed out and ready for review by your peers.

I will then also give you feedback ahead of the weekend where you can refine and present your final work in level 3.
