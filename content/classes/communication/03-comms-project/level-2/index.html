<p>We’re now going to apply some of the design ideas from <a href="../level-1/">level 1</a> to scientific posters more specifically.</p>
<p>Below are some poster examples.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="posters/poster1.jpg">Poster 1</a></li>
<li><a href="posters/poster2.pdf">Poster 2</a></li>
<li><a href="posters/poster3.pdf">Poster 3</a></li>
<li><a href="posters/poster4.jpg">Poster 4</a></li>
<li><a href="posters/poster5.pdf">Poster 5</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I have also assigned you a discussion group and a poster for you to review (check slack). You should review your poster together and think about the answers to the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the audience for this poster?</li>
<li>How easy was it to get the general message? Why?</li>
<li>What design elements were effective?</li>
<li>What design elements were ineffective?</li>
</ul>
<p>We’re then going to meet in class on Monday June 21 to share key takeaways you had on your poster that combines each group’s thoughts. In this way, we’ll compile a list of best practices. We will then discuss specific requirements for your poster.</p>
