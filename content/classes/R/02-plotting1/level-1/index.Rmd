Now that we've covered some of the more abstract basics, we're going to get stuck in having some fun and making some figures. 

The tool we are going to be using is the ggplot package. It's a powerful and flexible way to make graphics and it used widely by scientists analyzing data.

You can check out tons of examples of the different types of graphics that ggplot can create [here](https://r-statistics.co/Top50-Ggplot2-Visualizations-MasterList-R-Code.html) with the code used to create them.

## Exercise

To begin your journey into creating graphs in R, you should also go through [this primer](https://rstudio.cloud/learn/primers/1.1) on visualization using ggplot. It includes interactive code chunks for you to try out the ideas as you go.

You can move on to [level 2](../level-2/) as and when you feel comfortable with the above. Please fill out an exit ticket below.
