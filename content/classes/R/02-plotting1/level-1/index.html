<p>Now that we’ve covered some of the more abstract basics, we’re going to get stuck in having some fun and making some figures.</p>
<p>The tool we are going to be using is the ggplot package. It’s a powerful and flexible way to make graphics and it used widely by scientists analyzing data.</p>
<p>You can check out tons of examples of the different types of graphics that ggplot can create <a href="https://r-statistics.co/Top50-Ggplot2-Visualizations-MasterList-R-Code.html">here</a> with the code used to create them.</p>

<p>To begin your journey into creating graphs in R, you should also go through <a href="https://rstudio.cloud/learn/primers/1.1">this primer</a> on visualization using ggplot. It includes interactive code chunks for you to try out the ideas as you go.</p>
<p>You can move on to <a href="../level-2/">level 2</a> as and when you feel comfortable with the above. Please fill out an exit ticket below.</p>
